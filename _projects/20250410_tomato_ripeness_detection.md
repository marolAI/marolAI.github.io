Farmers face a constant, costly challenge: how to know the perfect moment to harvest. Manual checks are slow, labor-intensive, and can lead to inconsistent quality and wasted crops.

To solve this, I built a 'digital assistant' prototype for the field. I developed and trained a Computer Vision model (using YOLOv8) to act as a fast, reliable 'second pair of eyes,' capable of identifying tomato ripeness directly from an image.

The result is a simple tool that provides farmers with instant, data-driven feedback. This helps them increase their yield, reduce waste, and support more sustainable farming practices.
