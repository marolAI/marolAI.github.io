Handling large volumes of paper documents is a common pain point in many industries. Manually sorting and categorizing specific documents, like ECOWAS ID cards, takes significant human effort, costs a lot of time, and can be incredibly inefficient and frustrating.
This project, the ECOWAS ID Card Classifier, was built to automate that challenge. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, a type of Computer Vision AI, to accurately classify ECOWAS ID cards directly from scanned paper documents or images.
By automating this task, the project aims to dramatically reduce manual workload, speed up processing, and eliminate the inefficiencies tied to paper-based handling.
