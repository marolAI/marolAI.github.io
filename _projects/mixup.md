 Imbalanced learning focuses on learning from imbalanced data.
SMOTE is a technique to address this issue, but it has limitations in predicting the minority class when data is highly skewed or outside the training set.
This is because of the use of ERM for training. Mixup is an algorithm that can overcome this limitation. 
The project aims to combine SMOTE and Mixup to predict fraudulent credit card transactions in an imbalanced dataset.
