Complex documents often hide the answers you need, and traditional chatbots can sometimes invent things (known as 'hallucinations'). Meet RAGi, designed to solve this. RAGi is an intelligent AI chatbot that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and an agentic design to actively search, verify, and pull accurate, citable information directly from your documents. This means you get reliable answers you can trust, fast.
