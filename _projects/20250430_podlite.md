Podcasts are a treasure trove of knowledge, but a single episode can be an hour long. Professionals, students, and curious minds often don't have the time to listen to everything, causing valuable insights to remain locked away and inaccessible.

I built PODLITE to act as an intelligent "research assistant." I engineered a pipeline that uses advanced Speech-to-Text (Whisper) to transcribe the audio and powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to read through the content. It then automatically distills the key ideas, extracts actionable highlights, and identifies who was speaking.

This tool transforms a time-consuming activity into an efficient learning experience. Users can grasp the core message of a 60-minute podcast in just 5 minutes, making knowledge more accessible and saving them valuable time. It turns passive listening into active, targeted understanding.
