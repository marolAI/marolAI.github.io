Visual Question Answering (VQA) involves answering questions about images using natural language. 
Initially, RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs with pretrained word embeddings were used for question-only baselines. 
However, with advancements, large-scale pretrained language models like BERT have become involved. 
This project aims to retrain and evaluate a language-only baseline VQA model using BERT.
