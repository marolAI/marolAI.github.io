Manually transcribing table data from images and scans is a major bottleneck. This process is slow, tedious, and highly prone to costly human errors that corrupt data.

I built a "Practical AI" web app using Streamlit and PaddleOCR. A user simply uploads an image, and the AI engine automatically detects, parses, and extracts the table data.

This tool converts a multi-hour manual task into a 10-second process. It saves massive amounts of time, ensures data accuracy, and frees up professionals for high-value analytical work.
