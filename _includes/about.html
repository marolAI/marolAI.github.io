        <p><i>"I worked with Andriamarolahy R. for 1.5 years in a part-time capacity as a Junior Software Developer. During this time, he contributed to code implementation and revision in a methodologically complex innovation project, consistently demonstrating reliability and a solid grasp of best software engineering practices. His technical skills, particularly in Python (medical imaging algorithms, ML/AI, data visualization, data analysis, OOP), were at a mid-level when he joined, and he showed clear improvement over time. He was proactive in asking questions whenever clarification was needed, and he was always motivated and eager to learn. With his excellent work ethic and kind personality, he brought well-appreciated contributions to the project and team. I definitely recommend working with him."</i></p>
