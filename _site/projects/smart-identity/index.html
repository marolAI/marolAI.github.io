<p>In many organizations, employees are stuck doing tedious, repetitive work like manually sorting scanned documents. This process is slow, prone to human error, and a major bottleneck that prevents people from focusing on more valuable, complex tasks.</p>

<p>I developed an “automated digital clerk” to take over this repetitive task. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on thousands of examples, I taught the system to instantly recognize and classify ECOWAS ID cards from a mixed batch of scanned documents with high accuracy.</p>

<p>This simple automation tool has a dramatic effect on efficiency. It processes documents in seconds rather than minutes, eliminates sorting errors, and—most importantly—it frees up human employees from monotonous work. This allows them to apply their skills to customer service, problem-solving, and other areas where the human touch truly matters.</p>
