<p>Finding a specific piece of information in dense technical manuals, legal contracts, or research papers is incredibly frustrating. Worse, standard AI chatbots often “hallucinate” or invent answers, making them unreliable for critical tasks where accuracy is non-negotiable.</p>

<p>I built RAGI to be a “trustworthy expert” you can have a conversation with. Instead of just generating text, I designed it using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This means the AI must first find the relevant information directly within the source document, verify it, and only then use it to construct an answer you can rely on.</p>

<p>RAGI eliminates the guesswork and risk of AI hallucinations. It delivers accurate, verifiable, and citable answers, building the user’s confidence and saving them hours of manual searching. It’s a tool designed not just for answers, but for trust.</p>
