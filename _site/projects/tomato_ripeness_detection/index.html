<p>For farmers, knowing the exact ripeness of tomatoes in the field is crucial for harvesting at the right time, which directly impacts yield and quality. Doing this manually across large fields is incredibly labor-intensive, slow, and can even be inconsistent.
This project tackles that challenge: an Automated Tomato Ripeness Detection System. Using state-of-the-art Computer Vision powered by the YOLOv8 model, this system can accurately detect and classify the ripeness of tomatoes directly from images taken in the field.
The goal is to provide farmers with a tool for efficient, real-time crop monitoring, helping them make data-driven decisions to boost agricultural productivity and support sustainable farming practices.</p>
