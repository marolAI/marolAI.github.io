## About This Project

This is more than just a list of my skills; it's a reflection of my core belief that the best work is built on a foundation of **conscience and competence**. The site is designed to tell a story, demonstrating not just what I can do with technology, but how I think, solve problems, and collaborate with others.

My goal is to build reliable, useful solutions with a foundation of trust and clear communication.

## Key Features

*   **A Principle-Driven Narrative:** The "About" section introduces my core working principles: Integrity, Usefulness, and Calm.
*   **Problem-to-Solution Case Studies:** The "Projects" section is structured as a series of case studies, each telling a story from a real-world problem to a tangible impact.
*   **A "Working Philosophy" FAQ:** The "Contact" page includes a proactive FAQ section to build trust and provide insight into my process.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to starting new conversations. Whether you have a question, a project idea, or just want to talk about technology and its impact, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
